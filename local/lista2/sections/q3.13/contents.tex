\subsection{Questão 3.13}

\texttt{MPI\_Scatter} and \texttt{MPI\_Gather} have the limitation that each process must send or receive the same number of data items. When this is not the case, we must use the MPI functions \texttt{MPI\_Gatherv} and \texttt{MPI\_Scatterv}. Look at the man pages for these functions, and modify your vector sum, dot product program so that it can correctly handle the case when n isn’t evenly divisible by \texttt{comm\_sz}.
