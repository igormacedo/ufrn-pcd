Suppose comm\_sz = 4 and suppose that x is a vector with n = 14 components.

a. How would the components of x be distributed among the processes in a program that used a block distribution?

b. How would the components of x be distributed among the processes in a program that used a cyclic distribution?

c. How would the components of x be distributed among the processes in a program that used a block-cyclic distribution with blocksize b = 2?
