\subsection{Quest√£o 3.9}

Write an MPI program that implements multiplication of a vector by a scalar and dot product. The user should enter two vectors and a scalar, all of which are read in by process 0 and distributed among the processes. The results are calculated and collected onto process 0, which prints them. You can assume that n, the order of the vectors, is evenly divisible by \texttt{comm\_sz} .\\
