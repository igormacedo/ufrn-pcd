\subsection{Quest√£o 3.22}

Time our implementation of the trapezoidal rule that uses MPI Reduce . How will you choose n, the number of trapezoids? How do the minimum times compare to the mean and median times? What are the speedups? What are the efficiencies? On the basis of the data you collected, would you say that the trapezoidal rule is scalable?
