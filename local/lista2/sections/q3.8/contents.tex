\subsection{Quest√£o 3.8}

Suppose \texttt{comm\_sz = 8} and \texttt{n = 16}.

a. Draw a diagram that shows how MPI Scatter can be implemented using
tree-structured communication with \texttt{comm\_sz} processes when process 0 needs to distribute an array containing n elements.

b. Draw a diagram that shows how MPI Gather can be implemented using
tree-structured communication when an n-element array that has been distributed among \texttt{comm\_sz} processes needs to be gathered onto process 0.\\
