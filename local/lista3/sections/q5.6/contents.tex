\subsection{Quest√£o 5.6}

Write an OpenMP program that determines the default scheduling of parallel for loops. Its input should be the number of iterations, and its output should be which iterations of a parallelized for loop are executed by which thread. For example, if there are two threads and four iterations, the output might be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
Thread 0: Iterations 0 -- 1
Thread 1: Iterations 2 -- 3
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinputlisting[language=C]{sections/q5.6/code/omp_scheduling.c}
